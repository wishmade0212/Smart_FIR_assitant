## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### **1. Check Spam Folder**
Most email services filter automated emails to spam initially.
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Mark as "Not Spam" 
- Future emails will go to inbox

### **2. Wait 30-60 Seconds**
Email delivery can take up to 1 minute.
- Be patient
- Don't click register multiple times

### **3. Use Real Email**
Don't use fake or temporary emails.
- Gmail works best
- Yahoo works
- Outlook works
- Corporate emails might block it
